      "title": "Devising Innovative Solutions to Alleviate Traffic Congestion in Delhi with special focus on parking and traffic rule compliance",
      "overview": "Delhi, as one of the most densely populated cities in India, faces severe traffic congestion exacerbated by limited parking infrastructure, poor traffic rule compliance, and an ever-increasing number of vehicles on the road. Innovative solutions to tackle this issue require a multi-pronged approach. Strategies could include implementing smart parking systems that provide real-time parking availability updates to reduce illegal and double parking, enforcing stricter penalties for traffic violations through AI-enabled surveillance, and introducing congestion pricing in high-density areas to discourage unnecessary vehicular movement. Additionally, promoting shared mobility options, expanding pedestrian-friendly zones, and strengthening public transportation networks, such as electric buses and metro connectivity, can encourage a shift away from private vehicles. Collaboration between government bodies, tech companies, and civil society is essential to make these solutions both feasible and sustainable.",

This can be achieved through widespread awareness campaigns, community engagement, and the implementation of convenient systems like color-coded bins and doorstep collection of segregated waste. By ensuring that waste is sorted properly before it reaches landfills or incinerators, valuable resources can be recycled or composted, reducing the overall waste burden and environmental impact. The introduction of a robust circular economy model, where waste is treated as a resource, can further facilitate the transition to zero waste. Partnering with local recycling businesses and developing infrastructure for organic waste processing will be essential. Government incentives, coupled with stringent regulations, can encourage compliance, making waste segregation an integral part of urban living.",
